## 📌 What is `transform` in CSS?

The `transform` property allows you to visually manipulate an element by **rotating**, **scaling**, **translating**, or **skewing** it without affecting the document flow.

### ✨ Common Transform Functions:
- `translate(x, y)` – Moves the element along the X and Y axes.
- `scale(x, y)` – Scales the element (zooms in or out).
- `rotate(deg)` – Rotates the element clockwise or counterclockwise.
- `skew(x, y)` – Skews the element along X and/or Y axes.
- `matrix()` – Applies all transformations at once in a 2D space.
